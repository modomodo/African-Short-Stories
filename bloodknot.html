				<h1>The Blood Knot</h1>
				<p>By Athol Fugard</p>
			</header>
			<p>This play, first produced in Johannesburg, may be considered seminal in that it defines clearly the society of South Africa under apartheid, a society that Fugard loathed.</p>

			<p>Morris, who can pass for white, and his half brother, Zachariah, most definitely an African, share a one-room shack in the nonwhite slum of Korsten, near Port Elizabeth.</p>

			<p>Zachariah is completely illiterate and a little slow-witted, but he has a menial job as a gatekeeper. Morris acts as homemaker&mdash;cleaning their room, cooking the meals, mending Zachariah&rsquo;s clothing, and preparing nightly footbaths for his
				brother.
			</p>

			<p>In the year they have been together Morris has saved part of Zach&rsquo;s pay each week with the goal of accumulating enough cash to buy a small farm far from the area so that they can live as independent human beings.</p>

			<p>Zachariah, however, is more interested in the present than the future. He remembers a friend who used to help him squander each week&rsquo;s pay on wine and women, and he is quite resentful of his brother&rsquo;s somewhat puritanical attitude.</p>

			<p>To placate Zachariah, Morris suggests a pen pal, to be found in a newspaper listing women interested in this kind of activity. Not entirely convinced that this will take the place of &ldquo;having a woman,&rdquo; Zach finally chooses Ethel Lange, and
				dictates a letter to Morris. She replies, enclosing a picture of herself that brings Morris to his senses.</p>
